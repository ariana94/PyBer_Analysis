# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
In this analysis, we will be taking a look at some data from PyBer. Our goal is to help improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. To do this, we will be looking at weekly fares by city type.

## Results

According to our analysis, Urban cities bring in the largest amount of rides and total fares. However, Rural cities are paying the most per a ride even though they have the lowest amount of drivers available.

## Summary
With this data in mind, PyBer needs to look into the demand of a ride share service for Rural cities. If the demand is low, maybe offer limited services. If the demand is high, maybe lowering the price could allow more people to afford this service. PyBer could also look into increasing the fare amounts in Urban cities to increase its over all profit.
